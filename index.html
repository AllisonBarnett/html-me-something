       <p>As a former ESL teacher, I've been able to visit some amazing places. Here is a list of some of my favorite trips.</p>

        <h2 id="philmont">Philmont Scout Ranch</h2>
        <p>In 2016 I went on my first backpacking trip. My Dad and brother are involved in Boy Scouts, and when I heard that they were going to go on this epic adventure, I made them take me with them.
            For 10 days we hiked through the gorgeous mountains of New Mexico. There were fun activities to do along the way, like a mine tour, mountain biking, and panning for gold.<br>

            <br>One day we even climbed to the top of Mt. Baldy, which is 14,441 feet. A few of us suffered from altitude sickness, but everyone made it to the top!
            The trip was <em>far</em> from glamorous, but the views are unparalleled, and I deeply enjoyed being surrounded by nature with no phone. It was amazing how much your mentality changes when there's no electronics.

        <h2 id="san pedro">San Pedro de Atacama</h2>
        <p>I moved to Santiago, Chile in 2017 to teach English. Since I was already in the opposite hemisphere, I knew I had to see as many places as possible. So I started with San Pedro de Atacama. It's the 
            driest place in the world. Various countries have observatories there, and star-watching was one of our tours. I went with a fellow teacher, Tracy. We had so much fun enjoying this 
            amazing town. It was my first time in a desert, and it did not disappoint. <br><br>

            We rode bikes to the Moon Valley, and rode horses inside Devil's Throat canyon. One of my favorite places was the salt flat where you can watch flamingoes dancing for the shrimp. There are endless places to 
            explore here. I told Tracy I could happily come back and live here.

        <h2 id="easter">Easter Island</h2>
        <p>When I moved to Chile, I had no idea that this was the country Easter Island belonged to. It's an expensive trip, but luckily I was tutoring someone who worked for Latam Airlines, and they told me when there was a sale. 
            Room and board there is pricey too since the habitable part of the island is so small. Luckily I was able to find an awesome couchsurfer named Maca who let me stay with her and her roommate for free. 
            They were super sweet, and one night we stayed up late drinking beer and talking. They were talking more, and trying to dumb it down for my limited Spanish all the while laughing at my 
            lacking pronunciation.<br><br>

            Easter Island will always have a special place in my heart. It feels like it's full of magic. There are so many historic sites and everything is so well preserved and protected, it feels like no time has passed
            at all. Kids still ride their horses to school. <br><br>

            Tours there are incredibly expensive. So I bought a book all about the island, and Tracy and I rented bicycles for a fraction of the price and rode around the island, stopping at all the famous spots and
            reading about them instead of paying for a guide. The next day we climbed up the rim of Rano Kau, the island's now dormant volcano. It protects a very specific type of flower that grows nowhere else. 
            
            <br><br>Which is how all of Easter Island feels. Like there's nothing else in the world like it.

        <h2 id="torres">Torres del Paine</h2>
        <p>Deep down in Patagonia there's an epic National Park called Torres del Paine. It's a place coveted by explorers from all over the world. When I finally made my way that far south, I knew I had to see this place. 
            I was not dissapointed. <br><br>

            I signed up for a 3 day hike, and got all my gear together. Day 1 I hiked up and up to see the towers themselves. It was about a 4 hour hike just to the top. On the way I made a friend from the Netherlands.
            We decided to hike together and we spent easily an hour at the top, just taking it all in and listening to the booming of the glacier. <br><br>

            The next day was our 12 hour trek, so we made sure to start early. We walked along the bank of a pristine lake that was the bluest blue I've ever seen. 
            One of my favorite things was that you could drink water straight from the stream. Everything is glacier fed. <br><br>

            My last day I had to hike to the ferry alone, and the weather had taken a turn for the worst. I had to hike through a forest that had recently suffered a forest fire. The branches were black
            and creepy, and the wind  whistling through them created a very spooky experience. As much as I loved the place, I was okay leaving when I did. It's a truly wild and untamed place, and my gear was not up
            to par. I would love to return one day though, and plan it all out better.

        <h2 id="hong kong">Hong Kong</h2>
        <p>The second place I taught English in was Hong Kong. I have an uncle who lived there for a time with his family and he loved it. I had always heard good things, and my best friend was living in Shenzhen, China
            at the time, just across the border. Long story short, I saved up and flew out there. My teaching experience ther was very different that Chile, and at times I hated it with a passion. I didn't last long.<br><br>

            But Hong Kong itself is an amazing place filled with so much history and modernity all in the same place. I could have happily lived there for much longer, but it's crazy expensive. I hope to go back some day, though
            I stopped paying my phone bill, so I'm not sure if that means I'll get arrested or not.
